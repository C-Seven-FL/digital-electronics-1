### Three-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer

1. Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_3bit_4to1.vhd`. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of mux_3bit_4to1 is
begin

    -- WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

end architecture Behavioral;
```

2. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!

   ![your figure]()

3. Listing of pin assignments for the Nexys A7 board in `nexys-a7-50t.xdc`. **DO NOT list** the whole file, just your switch and LED settings.

```shell
##Switches
...

## LEDs
...
```
